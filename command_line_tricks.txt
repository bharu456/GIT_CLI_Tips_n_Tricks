Below commands are tested in tcsh environment.

1. Howto add all untracked files automatically to the index / staging area:

git status | grep "^?" | awk '{print $NF}' | git add

2. In a particular git project, howto collect all commits with changed files:

git log --name-only 

3. Howto create bzipped tarball archive of source code but exclude .git, .gitignore and custom directories:

<workspace_dirname>tar cjf /path/to/store/source.tar.bz2 --exclude-vcs -X /path/to/exclude.list .

4. Howto collect all unmerged changes on a particular branch pushed by user X:

ssh remote-name gerrit query owner:userid status:open branch:/name/branch

5. Given a list of CRs, cherry picking of patches can be automated.

For every CR, fetch important details like refs and project name:

ssh remote-name gerrit query tr:<cr-id>

From the above, extracted refs and project name can be passed on git cherry pick command.

git fetch ssh://userid@gerrit.url.address.com:port_number <project_name> <refs_value> && git cherry-pick -x FETCH_HEAD

NOTE:
    With cherry pick command, -x flag is recommended as it helps to trace back the commit that was cherry picked.

6. How to parse manifest XML from command line:

cat /path/to//manifest/xml | grep -needed-flags <pattern-to-search>

grep -needed-flags <pattern-to-search> /path/to/manifest.xml

xpath -q -q //manifest /path/to/manifest/xml | grep -needed-flags <pattern-to-search>

Last of these commands, xpath, is written using XML::XPath Perl module to parse XML files. It tries to comply with XPath specs of WWW3.
